# Websites-Contributed-To
Below are links to a few other websites that I have contributed to.

http://celticchicago.com/
This site was made with the Drupal CMS, the Zurb Foundation CSS framework, SASS preprocessor, etc.

http://ardentmills.com/ 
The Ardent Mills website was created with html, css, and javascript.  I was not part of the original development
team, but I have made many updates to this site throughout the past months.
